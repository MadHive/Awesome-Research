## Books

*Books for Blockchain technologies*

* [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](https://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/) - Provides a comprehensive introduction to the revolutionary 
yet often misunderstood new technologies of digital currency


## Cryptography

*Resources for cryptography*

* [Supporting Nonmembership Proofs with Bilinear map Accumulators](https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/538.pdf) - An extension of Nguyenâ€™s 
bilinear map based accumulator scheme to support nonmembership witnesses and corresponding nonmembership proofs.
* [Universal Accumulators with Efficient Nonmembership Proofs](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ninghui/papers/accumulator_acns07.pdf) -  Unlike traditional accumulators,
this scheme also enables one to efficiently compute a nonmembership witness of any value that has not been accumulated. RSA based.
* [Tight Bounds for Sliding Bloom Filters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.5872.pdf) -  The problem of sliding Bloom filters has appeared in the literature in several communities,
but this work is the first theoretical investigation of it.

## Algorithms

*Useful algorithms, especially for big data and streaming*
* [HyperLogLog](http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf) - Estimating the number of distinct elements (the cardinality) of very large data ensembles.

## Privacy

*Resources for privacy*

* [ajenti](https://github.com/ajenti/ajenti) - The admin panel your servers deserve.
